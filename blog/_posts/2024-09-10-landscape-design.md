  Landscape architecture is a multidisciplinary field that blends art, science, and technology to shape the outdoor environment. My experience spans different scales and types of projects, from large city landscapes to intimate garden designs. Below, I’ll dive into some key aspects of my work, highlighting notable projects and insights from various levels of landscape architecture.

Designing at Every Scale: My Landscape Architecture Journey
{:.lead}

## Landscape Planning
### City Scale: Green Infrastructure
At the city scale, landscape planning focuses on creating sustainable, resilient urban environments through green infrastructure. My work in this area has included developing large-scale strategies that integrate natural systems—such as green corridors, rain gardens, and urban parks—into urban frameworks. By using nature-based solutions, these plans aim to improve urban resilience to climate change while enhancing livability and biodiversity.

### Campus: GIS Analysis
On a smaller, yet equally impactful scale, I have used Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to analyze and plan campus landscapes. GIS provides a powerful tool for understanding topography, hydrology, and spatial patterns, allowing for more informed decision-making. My work in this area has involved optimizing green spaces on educational campuses, ensuring that they support both ecological functions and the needs of students, faculty, and staff.

## Landscape Design
### City Center: Open Space – Shengang
In the heart of Shengang’s bustling city center, I worked on a major open space project designed to create a vibrant, accessible area for both residents and visitors. The design balances aesthetics and functionality, with green spaces, seating areas, and pathways that encourage movement and relaxation. It also incorporates sustainable elements, such as permeable paving and native plantings, to reduce environmental impact.

### Community: Chiwan
Chiwan is a community-focused project where the goal was to create an inclusive, interactive space that reflects the needs and values of local residents. My design incorporated playgrounds, community gardens, and shaded seating areas, fostering a sense of belonging and providing a multifunctional space for people of all ages to gather.

### Park: Gangtou
The Gangtou Park project was centered on revitalizing a public park to enhance its ecological value and recreational potential. My design introduced a mix of active and passive spaces, including walking trails, picnic areas, and restored wetlands. This project aimed to create a harmonious balance between natural habitats and human use, ensuring that the park remains a vital green space for the community.

## Garden Design
Garden design is a more intimate and detailed scale of landscape architecture, where every element plays a crucial role in shaping the overall experience of the space. I’ve worked on several private gardens, focusing on creating personalized outdoor environments that reflect the unique tastes and needs of the client. Whether it’s a serene retreat or a vibrant, plant-filled oasis, garden design allows for a deep connection between people and nature.

## Project List
Here’s a quick overview of some of the key projects I’ve worked on:

Shengang City Center Open Space
Chiwan Community Landscape

From large-scale environmental planning to the intimate details of garden spaces, I’ve had the opportunity to work at all levels within the field. Each of these areas represents a unique set of skills and design approaches, and I’m excited to share my experience and insights with you.

It only took me two days to make this website, from zero to at least working. It was easier than I thought, and thanks to the convenient tools and resources (Google, ChatPGT, GitHub, and Jekyll) I can learn it fast. Nowadays, we have many tools to build a simple website and everyone can just make their website. Maybe Laziness is indeed the biggest drive for technique advancement.

Here I would like to share the knowledge on how to build a personal website with three steps, from [where to start](#where-to-start) to [the platforms for making websites](#platform-for-making-website), and [GitHub and template searching](#github-and-template-searching). 

## Where to Start
By searching on Google or asking ChatGPT, you can easily inform yourself with some basic ideas about website construction. For a simple personal website, you can use a professional platform to help you or use a free website to build it with a bit more effort. 

## Platforms for Making Websites
Although it may cost some money, platforms such as WordPress, Squarespace, Wix, and Weebly make building a website super easy for everybody. They are all strong tools for building websites and are beginner-friendly. You only need to choose a suitable template and simply modify the content on it. A pretty website would be ready to be published. But to publish the website, you also need a hosting service, which usually comes with a price.

## GitHub and Template Searching
If you want to build a free website, GitHub would be a good choice. However, it is necessary to learn some basic knowledge of programming and website construction. You will also need to learn a bit more about GitHub itself to start the journey.

1. First, you need to have a GitHub account.
2. Then follow the [Quickstart for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) to learn some basic ideas about how to use GitHub, and build the simplest website using it.
3. After that, you can polish your website by adapting a nice template into it. Here, in [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/), you may find hundreds of website templates, you can then choose and copy one for your website.

That's all. Very simple, no?


###### Notes: 

1. Paying a professional platform is always the easy way to make a website while using GitHub requires a bit more effort. However, if you find trouble with building a website, no matter if it is about the operation or the visualization, you are welcome to contact me.
