Designing at Every Scale: My Landscape Architecture Journey
{:.lead}

From large-scale environmental planning to the intimate details of garden spaces, I’ve had the opportunity to work at all levels within the field. Each of these areas represents a unique set of skills and design approaches, and I’m excited to share my experience and insights with you.

It only took me two days to make this website, from zero to at least working. It was easier than I thought, and thanks to the convenient tools and resources (Google, ChatPGT, GitHub, and Jekyll) I can learn it fast. Nowadays, we have many tools to build a simple website and everyone can just make their website. Maybe Laziness is indeed the biggest drive for technique advancement.

Here I would like to share the knowledge on how to build a personal website with three steps, from [where to start](#where-to-start) to [the platforms for making websites](#platform-for-making-website), and [GitHub and template searching](#github-and-template-searching). 

## Where to Start
By searching on Google or asking ChatGPT, you can easily inform yourself with some basic ideas about website construction. For a simple personal website, you can use a professional platform to help you or use a free website to build it with a bit more effort. 

## Platforms for Making Websites
Although it may cost some money, platforms such as WordPress, Squarespace, Wix, and Weebly make building a website super easy for everybody. They are all strong tools for building websites and are beginner-friendly. You only need to choose a suitable template and simply modify the content on it. A pretty website would be ready to be published. But to publish the website, you also need a hosting service, which usually comes with a price.

## GitHub and Template Searching
If you want to build a free website, GitHub would be a good choice. However, it is necessary to learn some basic knowledge of programming and website construction. You will also need to learn a bit more about GitHub itself to start the journey.

1. First, you need to have a GitHub account.
2. Then follow the [Quickstart for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) to learn some basic ideas about how to use GitHub, and build the simplest website using it.
3. After that, you can polish your website by adapting a nice template into it. Here, in [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/), you may find hundreds of website templates, you can then choose and copy one for your website.

That's all. Very simple, no?


###### Notes: 

1. Paying a professional platform is always the easy way to make a website while using GitHub requires a bit more effort. However, if you find trouble with building a website, no matter if it is about the operation or the visualization, you are welcome to contact me.
