  Landscape architecture is a multidisciplinary field that blends art, science, and technology to shape the outdoor environment. My experience spans different scales and types of projects, from large city landscapes to intimate garden designs. Below, I’ll dive into some key aspects of my work, highlighting notable projects and insights from various levels of landscape architecture.

Designing at Every Scale: My Landscape Architecture Journey
{:.lead}

One of the things I love about landscape architecture is its versatility. It spans so many scales, and each one requires a different set of eyes and skills. At the city scale, it's about zooming out, seeing the bigger picture—how green infrastructure can soften the harshness of urban life, how we can mitigate the impacts of climate change, or how public spaces can foster community interaction.

## Landscape Planning
### Green Infrastructure for Risk Mitigation at a city scale
As cities continue to grapple with the complex challenges of climate change, flood risks, urban heat islands, and traffic congestion, the role of landscape planning at the city scale becomes increasingly critical. By integrating green infrastructure and nature-based solutions, we can create resilient, sustainable urban environments that address these risks head-on.

In my previous research project in Saint Martín, I worked on a green infrastructure plan to mitigate flood risks, applying analytical tools to find effective solutions, to address questions such as: _Where should interventions be placed? What type of green infrastructure will provide the most benefit? And, How can we model different scenarios to ensure the best outcomes for urban resilience?_

### GIS Analysis for Informed Landscape Planning
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is a powerful tool that plays a key role in landscape planning at both large and small scales. By combining GIS with Rhino and Python, we can model spatial relationships, optimize pathways, determine functional locations, and refine designs to meet diverse needs.

In the GIST campus project, GIS analysis was pivotal in understanding the site's complex environmental dynamics. We mapped the topography and hydrology of the area, identifying suitable locations for key water management features such as ditches, retention ponds, and drainage systems. Similarly, in the Songshan Lake Park project, where I was responsible for ecological and sustainable design, GIS was instrumental in determining suitable construction locations.

## Landscape Design
Then there’s landscape design—working on parks, campuses, and public spaces, which delves into the finer details of how spaces are experienced and how they function on a more human scale. Here, I will present three unique projects, each with its own distinct challenge and focus area.

### City Center Landmark: Creating a Dynamic Urban Space
In the heart of a bustling city center, I worked on a project that aimed to create a new urban landmark for a thriving business district. This project presented several challenges, primarily the need to manage multiple layers of traffic while crafting a space that would be both iconic and functional.

The project is called Shengang Square. Partnering with a renowned architectural firm, the design was not only about creating a visually striking landmark but also about improving the user experience.

### Community Design: Fostering a Sense of Belonging
In contrast to the fast-paced environment of the city center, this second project focused on a more intimate scale—a community-centered landscape design aimed at creating spaces where residents could feel a sense of belonging and identity.

### Park: Gangtou
The final project I present is a public park designed to enhance both its ecological value and recreational potential. This park was located in a reservoir, required to provide water resource protection as well as for recreation. The challenge in this project was finding the right balance between preserving the park’s natural habitats and introducing recreational features that would appeal to local residents. We implemented ecologically sound solutions, such as the use of native plants, permeable paving, and rainwater harvesting systems, to ensure that the park’s ecological footprint remained minimal.

## Garden Design
Garden design is a more intimate and detailed scale of landscape architecture, where every element plays a crucial role in shaping the overall experience of the space. I’ve worked on several private gardens, focusing on creating personalized outdoor environments that reflect the unique tastes and needs of the client. Whether it’s a serene retreat or a vibrant, plant-filled oasis, garden design allows for a deep connection between people and nature.

## Project List
Here’s a quick overview of some of the key projects I’ve worked on:

Shengang City Center Open Space
Chiwan Community Landscape
Gangtou Park Revitalization
Campus Green Space Planning and GIS Analysis
