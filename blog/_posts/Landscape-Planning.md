#old version text: Due to the travelling experiences, I had with my parents when I was a child, I have a strong interest in both nature and society. I would never get tired of experiencing, studying, and creating new things. I travel, live in different countries, learn about the local environment and people and draw and write about what I see... I worked as a researcher for two years and as a designer for another two years. For me, they have an important common point, which is studying and creating new things, no matter that is about knowledge, ideas or the environment... Some of my writing, and drawing about my research and design are shared on this website. I love feedback on any of these, so do not hesitate to reach out!

# About me
Landscape architecture, to me, is about creating spaces that resonate with people and nature alike. It's more than just arranging plants or designing parks—it's about understanding how the environment and human experiences intertwine. Whether I'm working on a large city-scale project or a small garden design, I approach each with the same mindset: how can this space tell a story, solve a problem, and enhance life?

One of the things I love about landscape architecture is its versatility. It spans so many scales, and each one requires a different set of eyes and skills. At the city scale, it's about zooming out, seeing the bigger picture—how green infrastructure can soften the harshness of urban life, how we can mitigate the impacts of climate change, or how public spaces can foster community interaction. It’s incredibly rewarding to know that the spaces we design have the power to shape cities and improve the daily lives of people who live there.

Then there’s landscape design—working on parks, campuses, and public spaces, where the goal is to merge function with beauty. Here, the challenge is in balancing the needs of users with the ecological health of the site. How do we create spaces that are not only visually stunning but also sustain themselves over time? In my projects, I strive to create environments that feel both natural and intentional, where every path, bench, and tree has a purpose.

Garden design is the most personal scale, and often the most rewarding. It's about creating a small world for someone, a place they can call their own and connect with on a daily basis. In garden design, every detail matters—the texture of the plants, the flow of the space, the play of light and shadow. It’s an intimate process, and I enjoy collaborating with clients to bring their visions to life, while still respecting the local environment.

Throughout my career, I’ve learned that landscape architecture isn’t just about aesthetics or sustainability—it’s about empathy. Understanding the needs of the community, the desires of a client, and the silent language of the land itself. Every project teaches me something new, and every space I design reflects not just a solution, but a story.

That’s what excites me about landscape architecture—the opportunity to make a meaningful impact at every scale, and to keep learning and evolving with each new challenge.
