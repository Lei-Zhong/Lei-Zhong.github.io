# I don't know what this page is, but I can use it as a blog blog page, but only a list blog page, so I created a new .md in the blog folder, and if you want to use this one, just change the file name from blog-tem.md to blog.md

# Featured tags need to have either the `list` or `grid` layout (PRO only).
layout: list
