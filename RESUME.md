#old version text: Due to the travelling experiences, I had with my parents when I was a child, I have a strong interest in both nature and society. I would never get tired of experiencing, studying, and creating new things. I travel, live in different countries, learn about the local environment and people and draw and write about what I see... I worked as a researcher for two years and as a designer for another two years. For me, they have an important common point, which is studying and creating new things, no matter that is about knowledge, ideas or the environment... Some of my writing, and drawing about my research and design are shared on this website. I love feedback on any of these, so do not hesitate to reach out!

# About me
Hi, I’m Lei, a passionate landscape architect with a strong foundation in both design and water management. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Landscape Architecture and a Master’s in Water Management, which together shape my approach to creating sustainable and aesthetically captivating outdoor spaces. With over four years of professional experience, including two years as a landscape researcher and two years as a practicing landscape architect, I’ve developed expertise in designing, planning, and managing projects from concept to construction.

My work focuses on blending ecological sensitivity with creative design solutions. I’m proficient in tools like AutoCAD, Rhino, SketchUp, Illustrator, and Photoshop, which allow me to create precise 2D plans, detailed 3D models, and compelling presentations. In addition to design, I have experience in project management, which has sharpened my ability to balance creative vision with technical execution and client needs.

Currently based in Berlin, I’m continuing to expand my expertise in landscape architecture and water-sensitive design, while also learning German to further integrate into the local industry. I’m always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and create designs that enhance both natural environments and the communities they serve.
